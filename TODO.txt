core_local fails, since the context (in) is not read during invocation of the user function.
This is the old issue that keeps crawling back, how to split the contexts in two (in, out) regarding placeholders.
Or, if it's even a good idea to split in two contexts, but I believe that's necessary for the async case. The response context
will definitely not be the same as the remote context.
